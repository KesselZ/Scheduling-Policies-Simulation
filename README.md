# Scheduling-Policies-Simulation
This project similate how different scheduling algorithm works in a operating system. I implemented: FIFO, LIFO, SRTF, Round roubin, Priority, Preeptive Priority scheduling algorithm. 

This program should follow the following invocation:
<program> [-v] [-t] [-e] [-p] [-s<schedspec>] inputfile randfile


To run it, a example is::

1. make
2. scheduler -v -sP2:4 input0 rfile
